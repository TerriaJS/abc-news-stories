ABC News Stories Map
====================

This is the code for our entry to the Innovate@Locate16 Hackfest. It uses Terria to plot the ABC Local News Photos dataset from data.gov.au onto a map of Australia, making it browsable by space and time, as well as mashing it up with PSMA suburb boundaries so you can find photos from your suburb.

As with most TerriaJS projects, this is a fork of https://github.com/NICTA/NationalMap.
