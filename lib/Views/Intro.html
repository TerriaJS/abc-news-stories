    This is a mash-up of the <a target="_blank" href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/abc-local-online-photo-stories-2009-2014">ABC Local
    Online Photo Stories 2009-2014 Dataset</a> with <a target="_blank" href="www.data.gov.au/dataset/psma-administrativeboundaries">
    Administrative Boundaries</a> (particularly suburbs), both provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://data.gov.au">data.gov.au</a>.

    The map allows you to explore a dataset of over 6000 photos, zooming in to see which have been taken in or around
    your suburb or town. You can use the "Find My Suburb" tab on the left to search for your suburb (via Bing Maps), and the map will zoom in.
    Click the coloured dots to view the photos that have been taken around you - you can then follow the link through
    to the story on ABC News, or scroll down to view which suburb that it was taken in.

<p>
    There's also a real-time view of the photos that were taken - click the "Change View" tab, unselect "ABC Photo Stories (2009-2014)"
    and select "ABC Photo Stories (Real-Time View). This will play through from 2009 to 2014, showing photos when they were taken.
    You can use the timeline to change the time that you're viewing - many more photos exist towards the end of the dataset
    than at the beginning.
